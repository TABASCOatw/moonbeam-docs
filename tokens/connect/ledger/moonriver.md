## Introduction {: #introduction } 

Hardware wallets provide a safer way to store crypto funds because the private key (used for signing transactions) is stored offline. Ledger offers two hardware wallet solutions at the time of writing: Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X.

You can interact with Moonriver using your Ledger hardware wallet through the Moonriver Ledger Live app. With the dedicated Moonriver app, you do not have to worry about setting the chain ID and you know you are connected to the right network. Please note that you can only use the Moonriver app to connect to the Moonriver network, it cannot be used to connect to other Moonbeam-based networks.

You also have the option of using the Ethereum app to connect to Moonriver. The main difference between using the Moonriver and the Ethereum app is that you have to specify the chain ID when you use the Etheruem app, which is 1285 for Moonriver. If you're interested in using the Ethereum app on Moonriver instead, you can check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam Using Ledger and the Ethereum App](/tokens/connect/ledger/ethereum){target=_blank} guide.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with your Ledger hardware wallet on Moonriver using the Moonriver app. This guide only illustrates the steps for a Ledger Nano X device, but you can follow along with a Ledger Nano S as well.

As of [// TODO ADD DATE], the Moonriver and Ledger Live integration was released, allowing you to send and receive MOVR tokens with your Ledger device directly in Ledger Live. With this integration, you'll no longer need to connect your Ledger to MetaMask. If you prefer this method, please skip ahead to the [Use Ledger Live to Send & Receive MOVR](#use-ledger-live) section of this guide.

If you prefer to use MetaMask as an intermediary between your Ledger device and Moonriver, make sure that your MetaMask is [connected to Moonriver](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=_blank}. 

As of [MetaMask version 10.5.0](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-and-ledger-integration-fixed/){target=_blank}, connecting your Ledger device with MetaMask on Chrome is easy again. You just need to have the latest version of MetaMask installed. 

## Install the Moonriver Ledger Live App {: install-the-moonriver-ledger-live-app }

The Moonriver app is dependent on the Ethereum app, so first you will need to install the Ethereum app. Once the Ethereum app is installed you will be able to install the Moonriver app without a problem. Please note that the Moonriver app is only for the Moonriver network, it will not work for Moonbeam or Moonbase Alpha.

4. Search for Moonriver (MOVR) in the **App catalog** and click **Install**. Again, your Ledger device will show **Processing** and once complete, the Moonriver app will appear on your Ledger device

In the Ledger Live app, you should see the Ethereum and Moonriver app listed under the **Apps installed** tab on the **Manager** page. After the apps have been successfully installed, you can close out of Ledger Live.

## Import your Ledger Account to MetaMask {: #import-your-ledger-account-to-metamask } 

Now that you've installed the Ledger Live apps, you can connect your Ledger to the computer, unlock it, and open the Moonriver app.

If MetaMask was able to connect successfully to your Ledger device, you should see a list of five Moonriver/Ethereum-styled accounts. If not, double-check that Ledger Live is closed, you've connected your Ledger device to the computer, unlocked it, and have the Moonriver app open.

--8<-- 'text/ledger/import-accounts.md'

![MetaMask Select Ethereum Accounts to Import](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-5.png)

If you've imported your Ledger account successfully, you should see your account and balance displayed in the main MetaMask screen like shown in the following image:

![MetaMask Successfully Imported Ledger Account](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-6.png)

You can switch accounts in MetaMask at any time to view the balance of your other imported Ledger accounts.

You've now successfully imported a Moonriver compatible account from your Ledger device and are now ready to start interacting with your Ledger device.

Next, you will need to obtain some MOVR tokens and using the address you just copied, send the tokens to your account. After the transaction has successfully gone through, you will see your balance update.

## Send Tokens {: #send-tokens } 

Next up is sending and signing transactions on Moonriver using your Ledger device. To get started sending a transaction, click on the **Send** button:

![MetaMask Ledger Transaction Wizard](/images/tokens/connect/ledger/moonriver/ledger-9.png)

Right after you've approved the transaction, MetaMask sends it to the network. Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be displayed as **Send** on the **Activity** tab in MetaMask.

And that is it! You've signed a transaction and sent some MOVR tokens using your Ledger hardware wallet!

## Use Ledger Live to Send & Receive MOVR {: #use-ledger-live }

You can also use your Ledger device to send and receive MOVR tokens securely from within Ledger Live. This enables you to manage your MOVR tokens without connecting your device to MetaMask.

When you open up the Ledger Live app, make sure that you've installed the latest updates. If there are any pending updates that need to be installed, there will be a banner at the top of the screen that prompts you to install the updates.

To get started, you'll need to login to your Ledger device to unlock it. From Ledger Live, click on **My Ledger**. On your device, you'll be prompted to allow Ledger manager; you can click both buttons on your device to allow it.

Once on the Ledger manager, you'll need to make sure that your firmware is up to date, and if the Moonbeam and/or Ethereum apps need to be updated, go ahead and install the latest versions.
